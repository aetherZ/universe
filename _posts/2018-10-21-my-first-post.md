Greetings and welcome to my blog. I just generally post tons of stuff on this space of mine, from github creations to playing games and doing spectacular things with them. I came up with the term `aezlo`, about `1 year, 2 months ago`. I came up with the name after remembering the word `aether`, which is Greek for sky. 

I have tons of usernames across the web, some of which are listed below:
 + [Codepen Username](https://codepen.io/aezloU)
 + [Dribble Username](https://dribble.com/aezloM9)
 + [Github Username](https://guthub.com/aezloM9)
 + [Site Repository](https://github.com/aezloM9/aezloM9.github.io)
 + [Home](http://athelo.net)
 + [Blog Repository](https://github.com/aezloM9/universe)
 + [Blog](http://athelo.net/universe)
 + [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuMgKPyGB5ByO7MWhQoXw5g)
 
I also play Fifa from time to time, and will show you progress of the team as time goes on.
Anyway, I have got some suggestions for other sites to check out:
